            <h3> Car Price Prediction System 2</h3>
            <p>Car price prediction using Machine Learning (ML) involves building a model to estimate the price of a car based on various features or attributes such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, brand, fuel type, and other relevant factors. By training a machine learning algorithm on historical data of car sales, the model learns patterns and relationships in the data that allow it to predict the price of a car given the features.</p>
